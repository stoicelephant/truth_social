This is a project where I analyze news to try and predict stock flutuations. 


What we will need to develop
1) A way of collecting / scraping trumps “truths” off of truth social - https://github.com/stanfordio/truthbrush 
2) A way of filtering out the “junk posts” 
3) Analyzing the sentiment of the posts 
4) Predicting the market movements along with relative size and confidence
